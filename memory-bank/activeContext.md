# Active Context

## Current Focus
Recently completed major website refinements and fixes. All user requests have been implemented and pushed to main branch.

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)
1. **Supabase Backend Integration**:
   - Added typed Supabase client and `Database` types
   - Implemented `projects`, `site_configs`, `testimonials` tables with RLS
   - Enabled realtime for `projects` (REPLICA IDENTITY FULL)
   - Created `portfolio-admin` Edge Function for admin CRUD with JWT admin check
   - Added RPCs: `get_admin_user`, `link_admin_user`
2. **Admin Portfolio Flow**:
   - Admin CRUD writes first attempt direct PostgREST, then fallback to Edge Function on RLS failure
   - Frontend subscribes to realtime changes for instant updates
3. **Config Stores -> Supabase**:
   - `solutionsStore` and `visualSolutionsStore` now read/write `site_configs` keys and mirror to localStorage
4. **Auth Handling**:
   - `useSupabaseAuth` listens to auth changes, checks admin, and links admin user
5. **UI/Content Tweaks**:
   - Kept previous homepage, navigation, and contact simplifications intact (no regressions)

## Current State
- Admin panels use Supabase as source of truth with realtime updates
- Homepage displays business and visual solutions sections (configs from `site_configs` when available)
- Contact form simplified and functional
- Navigation properly themed for different page backgrounds
- RTL text rendering correctly throughout
- All changes committed and pushed to main branch

## Next Steps
- Deploy Edge Function and confirm RLS policies in production
- Monitor realtime and admin CRUD flows in production
- Ready for new feature requests or refinements
